# Reaction_Timer_Display
Calculates, displays human reaction time to a flashing light.

Date: November 2, 2020
Instructions: Create a new Vivado project and add the three files. Be sure to use Nexys A7
Project Name: Reaction Timer


To measure the human response to an event, the Reaction Timer would wait for the user to enable the device by clicking on an “Enter” button. The circuit would wait for some amount of time and then it would flash a white LED. As soon as the user recognizes the light, the user should react by clicking the “Stop” button. The machine will calculate the time that took the user to react and display it on the Seven-Seg-Display. Errors will accrue when the user does not press the stop button for 9.999 seconds after the white light was shown and when the user presses the stop button before the white light is ON.
